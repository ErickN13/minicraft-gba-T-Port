# Minicraft for GBA

This is a demake of Minicraft by Markus Persson (aka Notch), a game made for
Ludum Dare 22 in two days.

My aim is to make a version that is as close as possible to the original.
Of course the GBA has a lot of hardware limitations but, since the game isn't
too complex, I could port it without too many problems. When the limitations
were impossible to overcome, I had to hack a few things, change others, put
limits and so on.

To improve the experience, I also added a pause menu and a way to save and load
the world.

## Differences due to Hardware limitations
|                | Original | GBA Demake |
| -------------- | -------- | ---------- |
| World size     | 128x128  | 112x112    |
| Entity limit   | ∞        | 255        |
| Chest limit    | ∞        | 32         |
| Inventory size | ∞        | 128        |
